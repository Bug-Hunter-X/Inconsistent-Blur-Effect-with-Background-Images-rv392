# Inconsistent Blur Effect with Background Images in CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `filter: blur()` property when used with `background-image`. In some browsers, the blur effect may not apply correctly, or might be completely ignored, particularly with gradients or complex images.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code.  The `solution.css` file offers a potential workaround.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and browser-specific compatibility issues.

This issue has been observed in [list browsers affected], although the extent of the inconsistency may vary.

Feel free to contribute any findings or solutions.
